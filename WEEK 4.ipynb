    "### A problem that I would like to resolve is where the best location would be to open a restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA. Foursquare API will be resourceful in determining a solution because of its ability to provide other data about where restaurants thrive in the city. It will give insight on the most fruitful location for a successful business. This is useful information to anyone looking to become a  restaurateur. Pittsburgh is home to many athletes, entrepreneurs and other small business owners who may be interested in opening their own restaurant in hopes to become the next tourist attraction in the city. The steel city brings in a lot of traction year-round for a multitude of reasons so, opening a restaurant in a prime location could be a life-changing business opportunity for anyone intrigued! "
